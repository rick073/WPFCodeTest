Code Test: Task Manager
We are in need of a simple task manager application so that we can create tasks for ourselves and to check off tasks as we complete them.
We need to be able to:
See the current date in the application.
Create a new tasks.
Name and rename tasks.
Assign a date a task is due.
Mark a task as being completed.
Delete tasks that are no longer important.
To aid us in deciding what to do next, tasks that are completed in the application should be highlighted in green and tasks that are overdue should be highlighted in red.
